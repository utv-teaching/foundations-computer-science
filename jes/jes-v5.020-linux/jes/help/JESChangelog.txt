JES Changelog
=============
This changelog only covers changes in JES versions 5.0 and later.
Our records of what changed in version 4.3 and earlier are fragmentary.

JES 5.01
--------
Release Date: Sept 10, 2014

Fixing Developer: Mark Guzdial

Save out files without CR line endings -- replace \r\n with \n.

Had to update jarbuilder so that it would compile on MacOS X until Java 1.6.

JES 5.0
-------
Release Date: August 31, 2014

Supervisor: Mark Guzdial

Primary Developer: Matthew Frazier

Contributors: Christine Alvarado, Stephen Bryant, Bill Manaris

### User Interface Improvements

*   Allow the color scheme of the command window to be switched.
    Several new themes are included, many which print function return
    values in a different color than `print` output.
    The yellow-on-black JES 4.3 theme remains the default, however.

*   Instead of displaying `java.lang.ThreadDeath`, stopping the
    program while it's running displays a simple message,
    `[The program was stopped by the stop button.]`

*   Added a list of recently opened and saved programs to the
    `File` menu.

*   Added a `Clear command window` option to the `Edit` menu, which
    empties the command window of all text (but preserves history and
    defined variables).

*   Added "Stop" buttons to dialogs created by the `requestString` and
    `showInformation` families of functions. These stop the program
    just like the "Stop" buttons on the main window, which allows
    students to stop infinite loops involving dialogs.
    (They can't use the main window's "Stop" buttons because the
    dialog boxes lock up the main window.)

*   Removed the code that types a function's name when it it selected
    from the "JES Functions" menu. (Users reported that when students
    are consulting the Functions menu for information on a function,
    they usually haven't decided whether they want to use it yet.)

*   Added an "Open Recent Program" menu that tracks the last 8 files
    opened or saved.

*   Fixed the rules for deciding when a filename is illegal,
    but allowed the users to override JES's decision.

*   Filtered out non-.py files in Open and Save by default.

*   Improved the layout of program printouts, to properly center- and
    right-align the headings and provide additional space for the
    program text.

*   Moved settings into a `.properties` file, which is stored in the
    user's platform-specific preferences directory.
    (Previously, settings were stored in a delicately-formatted `.txt`
    file stored in the root of the user's home directory.)

*   Made version information available in the Command Window:
    type `version` to print out the JES, Java, and Jython versions.
    More detailed version information is also provided on the
    splash screen.

*   All the platform-specific installers now register JES as a handler
    for .py files, so students can open JES just by double-clicking
    a file.

*   Allowed the name of a script file to edit to be passed on JES's
    command line.
    (Windows support for this is thanks to Stephen Bryant,
    who created a new `JES.exe` that supports command-line arguments.)

*   Added code to handle I/O errors that happen while opening files
    (such as insufficient access).

### Media API Improvements

*   Added a plugin system, to allow add-on libraries to be easily
    packaged for use with JES. Plugins are distributed as JAR files,
    and they can be installed by selecting "Install Plugin" from the
    "File" menu, choosing the JAR file, and restarting JES.
    Instructions for making plugins are included in the JES
    source code repository.

*   Renamed `setLibPath` to `addLibPath`, since there can be more than
    one library path. (The old name still works.)

*   Corrected `requestString` so that it returns the object `None`
    instead of a string with the word `"None"` when the user clicks
    "Cancel," like the other `requestType` functions.

*   Added a version of the Turtle `getDistance` method that accepts
    another turtle, and computes the distance to its x and y
    coordinates.

*   Bundled the libraries from Bill Manaris' Jython Music system.
    This allows students to run programs from "Making Music with
    Computers: Creative Programming in Python," by Manaris.

*   Bundled a copy of jMusic. It's not officially integrated into the
    media API, but the `jm` package is available for import.
    (All of the instruments from the jMusic instruments Web page are
    included, but they must be imported from the `instruments`
    package - for example, `from instruments import SineInst`.)

### Interpreter Improvements

*   Upgraded to Jython 2.5, granting access to new Python language
    features and providing a significant speedup for many programs.

*   Rewrote the interpreter threading code to avoid race conditions
    and provide better isolation from the GUI.

*   Displayed printed messages on the command window immediately,
    thus making the `printNow` function unnecessary.
    (It has not been removed, however.)

*   Cleaned up exception display and message extraction.

*   Added the `__file__` variable to the interpreter context,
    allowing the JES test suite to be executed from within JES.

### Development Workflow Improvements

*   Reorganized the JES repository layout, to separate the Java code,
    Python code, static resources, and unit tests into separate
    directories.

*   Created an Ant Buildfile to fully automate the build and release
    process, including the construction of Windows installers and
    Mac OS X .app packages.

*   Added debugging switches for testing JES and reporting system
    information. (See `working-on-jes/launching-jes.md` for details.)

*   Added a `debugJES()` function that, when called, returns the
    instance of `JESProgram` for debugging purposes.

*   Created a "testing kit" which users can download to run JES tests
    and demo programs on a release version of JES.

*   Started signing released JAR files.

*   Added Jason Kirtland's "Blinker" library for internal use.

*   Deleted massive quantities of unused code.

### Bug Fixes

*   Corrected the spelling of "Loading Program."
    (Previously, it was "Loading Progam.")

*   Fixed the Watcher's speed slider and stop buttons.
    Now, they function as intended on all platforms.

*   Fixed the "Remove Variable" button in the Watcher.

*   Made the Watcher change UI skins with the rest of the application,
    and corrected the appearance of the buttons on non-Metal skins.

*   Moved all GUI-construction code in the startup phase to the Event
    Dispatch Thread, eliminating at least one random crash bug.

*   Fixed `SimplePicture`'s extension-detecting code to split on the
    last dot in the filename instead of the first.

*   Limited font sizes to the range 8 -- 72, inclusive.
    (While JES's UI would not display font sizes outside this range in
    previous versions, if one ended up in the configuration file,
    it would be used even if it made the display unreadably
    small or large.)

*   Corrected SimpleTurtle to use 0.5-based rounding instead of
    truncation. (Thanks to Christine Alvarado from UC San Diego for
    discovering this bug and contributing a patch!)

*   Removed the occasional duplicate `>>>` prompts in the
    Command Window.

*   Prevented `...` prompts in the Command Window from being
    backspaced over.

*   Deleted unnecessary `print` statements.

### Removed Functionality

*   Removed the Turnin system. User surveys revealed that it is no
    longer in use, and it may not have functioned to begin with.
    The Web-CAT submission engine may be integrated in the future to
    provide a replacement.

*   Removed the Logging system (which created a `.pylog` file next
    to each `.py` file). It appeared to be in a state of ill repair
    already (for example, the "Logging" checkbox in the settings window
    did nothing), and internal refactoring to JES made it difficult to
    keep the log file up to date with the same set of information.
